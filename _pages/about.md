<p>Oh hi there. I'm Titus. What's your name?</p>

<p>Here's a little bit more about me (not that you asked).</p>

<p>First, and most importantly, I am a follower of Jesus Christ. I believe in the God of the Bible, who is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus is my Savior, my Friend, and my Brother, and I live in freedom from sin because of what He has done for me. I owe Him everything, including this blog. He is the best thing about me, and He is my eternal destination. There was a time in my life when I sought happiness and satisfaction in a lot of different places, and none of them could fill me. But someone took the time to share the good news about Jesus with me, that God loved us so much that He sent us His only Son to die to take the punishment for our sins (John 3:16, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:1-10). As I came to understand this more, I realized that there was something much more wrong with me than just that I was pursuing the wrong things - I was separated from God because of my sin. But praise Jesus, He bridged that gap by dying a horrific death for me on the cross to pay the price for my sins. In the Bible, Jesus says that if we just repent and believe in Him, then we will be saved. So that's what I did. I turned from my sin and gave my life to Him. Now I'm a new creation. I'm forgiven. I'm a child of the one true God, my Father, who loves me more than I ever thought possible. I hope you have a story like that, too.</p>

<p>Less significant information about me is that I hail from the beautiful state of North Carolina, where we have good BBQ (just not as good as Texas), legendary college basketball rivalries (Go Heels!), and access to both beautiful mountains and subpar beaches (but beaches nonetheless). I come from an amazing family, of which I am the middle child, and I have always enjoyed doing all things active. If you say "sports", I'm in.</p>

<p>As far as my academic journey, I studied at The College at Southeastern, where I received a BA of Student Ministry. My aspiration at the time was to be a youth pastor, but the Lord seems to have had other plans for me. Toward the end of my undergraduate degree, I began to wrestle with the idea of international missions, something I had never really given any genuine contemplation. However, being at the Great Commission Seminary seems to have had some impact. I knew early on in my undergraduate degree that I would want to continue education at the graduate level, but this idea of missions redirected the focus of my graduate study. I am now studying for an MA of Intercultural Studies at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. The goal is to fill in some of the gaps that I am sensing as it relates to cross-cultural ministry - as much as I can in the classroom anyway. And that's where I am now - still studying, still waiting. But preparing to go wherever God leads.</p>

<p>The last thing I will say about myself, I guess, would explain why in the world I have this blog. I am a "thinker". I didn't say I'm smart. But I think a lot. I like to investigate. I like to learn. I like to ask questions that typically go unasked. And a lot of times, I find myself with a lot of different thoughts about a lot of different things, and I don't really have a way to process or express them. So, here we are. I pray that my overactive mind may perhaps serve you in some way and encourage you to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. He's worthy of all of it, isn't He?</p>

<p>Anyway, it's nice to meet you, and I'm glad you're here!</p>
